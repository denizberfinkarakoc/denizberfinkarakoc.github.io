I have had the opportunity to lead a number of interesting research projects during my M.S. and my Ph.D. My research combines network science, data analysis, optimization, multi-criteria decision-making, econometrics, and geographic information science methods to investigate the resilience of agri-food flow networks across spatial scales and then proposes practical solutions ensuring societal well-being and environmental stability. 

Agri-food supply chains are complex systems that incorporate production, distribution, processing, and consumption of perishable goods. Their safeguarding is essential to feed humanity. However, food supply chains have become subject to an array of unforeseen threats, such as climate change, pandemics, cyber intrusions, geopolitical conflicts, and economic crises. As “affordable and available food for everyone, at all times” ensures a stable economy and civil rest, my research recognizes food supply chains as non-traditional defense objects. I concentrate on their distribution step (i.e., food flow networks) which serves as the bridge between supply and demand. I lead descriptive and predictive analytical studies to ensure resilient agri-food flow networks; thus, food security. Here is a summary of some of my research efforts.

## Mapping U.S. agri-food flows on multi-modal transportation infrastructure

<!-- <p style="text-align: justify"> -->
<b>Currently, I leveraged my experience in data analytics, network science, and geographic information science and developed a unified framework to map U.S. domestic, import, and export food flows on multi-modal transportation infrastructure. </b>
 
In this study, I will evaluate how the load of agri-food supply chains change by flow type and transportation mode. Further, I will assess the efficiency vs. adaptability against disruptions balance among inland highways, railways, and waterways within the U.S. using econometrics and complex network science. My findings will illuminate the real-world implications of cost vs. benefit in agri-food flow network resilience.

## Optimization of national grain imports to balance risk vs. return

<!-- <p style="text-align: justify"> -->
<b>Recently, I explored the interplay of unit cost, cost volatility, and supply diversity in national grain imports with modern portfolio theory. Nations that rely on more risky suppliers are observed to be also paying more unit cost of trade. To introduce portfolios that adeptly balance risk vs. return, I formulated a mean-variance optimization model with mass balance. I showed the potential for nations to mitigate risks while lowering costs by supplier diversification.</b>
 
Many nations rely on imported grain to meet their dietary requirements. Grain imports may be at risk due to weather shocks, economic crises, or international conflicts. Countries aim to balance import risk with the expected return of their grain supplies. I brought these dual objectives of grain trade together by employing modern portfolio theory. Using Markowitz mean-variance optimization model, I identified opportunities to reduce risk in existing national grain import accounts, under realistic supply mass constraints of trade partners. I proposed both optimal and optimum portfolios to determine opportunities for importer nations to achieve more stable and diverse grain supplies, while also acknowledging economic considerations.

## Structural chokepoints of U.S. agri-food flow networks

<!-- <p style="text-align: justify"> -->
<b>I fused multi-criteria decision-making and network science for a vital component-importance analysis of food flows within the U.S. to address President Biden's Executive Order [#1407](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/executive-order-on-americas-supply-chains/). Based on network connectivity, resilience, and efficiency, urban centers emerged as key hubs for processed food transit, but diverse food production geographies led to distinct chokepoints.</b>
 
The agricultural and food systems of the United States are critical for ensuring the stability of both domestic and global food systems. Thus, it is essential to understand the structural resilience of the country’s agri-food supply chains to a suite of threats. I employed complex network statistics to identify the spatially resolved structural chokepoints in the agri-food supply chains of the United States. The term ‘structural chokepoints’ of agri-food supply chains indicate the critical distribution hubs that hold the physical network structure together and contribute to the efficient movement of goods. These pinpointed structural chokepoints are also found to be generally consistent through time, particularly for processed food commodities.

## Temporal food flows between U.S. counties

<!-- <p style="text-align: justify"> -->
<b>I estimated food movement across U.S. counties in 2007, 2012, and 2017 by a machine learning model, and uncovered spatial trends by time-series analysis. This study inspired further collaborative research on carbon footprint of cold-chain food flows amidst climate change, and spatially detailed food trade link between China and the U.S. To share the key findings of these studies with public, an openly available data visualization portal, [foodflows.org](), is built together with the UIUC College of Education.</b>
 
Even though previous research has developed novel methods to estimate food flows with high spatial resolution, currently it is not understood how fine-grained food supply chains vary in time. I built on this literature by continuing to focus on fine grained spatial fluxes of food, but with the additional consideration of time. I developed an improved version of the Food Flow Model, which is a data-driven model, to estimate food flows (kg) between all county pairs across all food commodity groups for the years 2007, 2012, and 2017 which requires estimating 206.3 million links. Then, I determined the core counties to the U.S. food flow networks through time by leveraging a multi-criteria decision analysis technique, TOPSIS.

## Resilience and efficiency trade-off in global food trade

<!-- <p style="text-align: justify"> -->
<b>I captured the logistics of agri-food trade with a network science perspective and assessed the balance between efficiency and resilience using statistical connectivity metrics. As unprecedented in investigating the interplay between efficiency and resilience for global food trade, I revealed that trade of food groups is more at equilibrium than individual commodities.</b>
 
Trade is typically optimized to promote efficiency, whereas resilience is increasingly being recognized as another important objective. However, it is not clear if prioritizing resilience comes at the expense of efficiency or if the two objectives can be promoted simultaneously. I developed a complex network framework, built upon the repeat movement of food commosities between nations, to quantify the efficiency and resilence of food trade for the last century. I observed that there is a competitive relationship between efficiency and resilience when only network topology is considered. However, a cooperative relationship between efficiency and resilience exists when the intensity of trade connections is accounted for.

## Social vulnerability and equity perspectives on interdependent infrastructure resilience [MobiCom'20, S&P'23]

<!-- <p style="text-align: justify"> -->
<b>I developed two systems, <a href='/files/FaceRevelio.pdf'>FaceRevelio</a> and IoTCupid to enable reliable and secure user and device authentication to protect users’ private information (e.g., contacts, messages, credit card details) on commodity mobile and allow secure communication between IoT devices.</b>

 <a href='/files/FaceRevelio.pdf'>FaceRevelio</a> is a novel liveness detection system that protects facial authentication mechanisms on commodity smartphones from spoofing attacks, without requiring effort from the users or any external hardware. It leverages the smartphone screen as a light source and illuminates different portions of the screen with random lighting patterns for a short duration (∼1 second) to simulate multiple lighting conditions. The reflection of the light from the screen is recorded and then used to extract stereo images of the face and its 3D surface through a photometric stereo technique. The reconstructed 3D surface differentiates a real human face from its 2D counterpart and defends against spoofing attacks. This work was presented at MobiCom 2020.

More recently, I developed, IoTCupid, a new secure, and usable decentralized group pairing system for IoT devices with heterogeneous sensing modalities. My work demonstrates that two devices can use the time interval between the subsequent occurrences of a commonly observed event type (e.g., coffee-machine-on events sensed by the microphone and power meter) as proof of co-presence and use them as evidence to establish a symmetric key. IoTCupid proposes a novel group key establishment protocol that enables dynamic group generation among devices and is resilient to man-in-the-middle, offline brute force and denial of key exchange attacks. This work was recently accepted to IEEE S&P and will be available online soon.
 
<b>Impact: </b> My work on liveness detection has gained recognition from both academia and industry, and a patent has been approved for it. Our work on IoT device pairing has encouraged the integration of secure and usable pairing mechanisms in emerging decentralized IoT systems such as Thread/OpenThread. To this end, the tools and algorithms I have developed allow developers to implement effective systems for improving users’ security and privacy.
